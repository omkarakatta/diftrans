Description: Given the probability mass functions of two distributions 
  (say, pre-treatment and post-treatment distributions), the diftrans package 
  computes the displacement between them using optimal transport theory. 
  Introduced in Daljord, Pouliot, Hu, and Xiao (2020), the 
  differences-in-transports estimator compares two such displacements, e.g., 
  the displacement for the treated group and the displacement for some control
  group.
